\section{Summary of results}

% things that could be brought up
% predictions for bpleast if it was an EEG expt

%%%
% save for general discussion
%%%
% * LeabraTI: why do low frequency oscillations convey information about spatial predictability
%	  % Low frequency oscillations seem to capture spatial stuff too, not just temporal stuff although it's hard to know for sure without a better expt
%
%	  % 5 Hz better for temporal prediction time window than 10 Hz? Again, at least given current data, but hard to know
% * 5 Hz vs 10 Hz
% *		Is 5 Hz functionally different? Or just a subharmonic that is better suited for significance given the experimental parameters (200 ms blank)
%
% Stronger 10 Hz effects without attention
