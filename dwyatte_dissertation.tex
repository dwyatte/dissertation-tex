% Plus phase
% + Thalamic burst
% + Cortical amplification of Thalamocortical signals, causes ignition of microcolumn
%   through 2/3->5 and 5b burst to 6
% 	+ Find refs on this -- gating by synchrony. but synchrony is due to inhibition? 
%   + Possibly sensory + intrinsic bursting combo causes gating
%
% Minus phase
% + Next 100-len(bursting) ms characterized by endogenously (L6) driven inputs
% + Thalamus doesn't burst, information already gated down in column, so it becomes primary driver
%   + Should sensory still be let in through feedforward path? Or does it *never* get past L4?
%
% BeierleinFallRinzelEtAl02 - burst > 40 Hz 
% WangSpencerFellousEtAl10 - sync
% FeldmeyerLubkeSilverEtAl02 - sync
% TiesingaFellousSejnowski08 - sync
%
% " Thalamocortical synapses are more effective than intracortical synapses94, but they form only a small fraction of the synapses onto L4 stellates."

% TODO
% * microcircuit latencies
% * Nesting of gamma within alpha, and actually is the ``duty cycle'' -- need to reread Spaak, Jensen papers
% * Add shared thalamus to figure and generally fix
% * Begin writing about alpha synchronization and desycnrhonization and how they are related to sensation and prediction -- cite relevant EEG evidence -- but save 		the bulk of this for the EEG section
% * analogies about carrier signals/duty cycles?
