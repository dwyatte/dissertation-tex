What is dissertation-tex?
----
I am open sourcing (and version controlling) my dissertation as I write it.

Why on earth would you do that?
----
Why not? By doing so, I get free off-site backups, version controlling, and a nice web interface. People can track my progress and transparency forces good work habits. And maybe being publically available will make me finish it faster (here's to hoping);

That sounds like a terrible idea. Won't you get scooped?
----
I don't know, this is an experiment. And I'm not sure if I will want to publish it after it's done anyway. In the worst case, I can always make the repo private. In the best case, maybe someone will make edits or I'll gain a collaborator.
