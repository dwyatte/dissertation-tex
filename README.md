What is dissertation-tex?
----
I am open sourcing (and version controlling) my dissertation as I write it.

Why on earth would you do that?
----
Why not? By doing so, I get free off-site backups, version controlling, and a nice web interface. I along with other people can track my progress and I'm a firm believer that transparency forces good work habits. Plus, maybe being publically available will make me finish it faster (here's to hoping).

That sounds like a terrible idea. Won't you get scooped?
----
I don't know, this is an experiment. The scientific community is small and I'm pretty sure they are not trolling GitHub for ideas. There are no data or simulations here yet (currently versioned by a private svn repo). Plus, I'm not sure if I will even want to publish it after it's done anyway. In the worst case, I can always make the repo private. In the best (but extremely unlikely) case, maybe someone will make edits or I'll gain a collaborator.

Where is everything?
----
Each chapter is in its own chap_* directory. Some files are not managed by git, so you might not be able to recompile. Just check out the PDFs if you want to play along though.
