\section{Methods}

\subsection{Participants}
A total of NN students from the University of Colorado Boulder participated in the experiment (ages NN-NN, mean=NN.NN years; NN male, NN female). All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision and received course credit as	compensation for their participation. Informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to the experiment in accordance with Institutional Review Board policy at the University of Colorado.

\subsection{Stimuli}
Novel ``paper clip'' objects (see REF PLEAST) were used as stimuli. A total of eight objects were created using the same method as in Experiment PLEAST. Four of the objects were target objects from Experiment PLEAST.
